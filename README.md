# React | Typescript | Parcel

<br />
<p>It Used React ðŸš€ with Typescript ðŸ”¥ and bundled everything using my favorite bundler, parcel ðŸ“¦. Also there are some other cool stuff used, like lodash, date-fns, jest, prettier.</p>

## How To Use

Clone the repository : 
`https://github.com/emadgit/polls.git`

<br />
Then install Parcel using Yarn (or npm):
<br />

Yarn : 

`yarn global add parcel-bundler`

npm : 

`npm install -g parcel-bundler`

After Parcel is installed, in your terminal go to root of the project ( where the package.json exist ) and run : 
<br />

`yarn`

This will install all the required dependencies. Then to run the project locally run : 
<br />

`yarn dev`

Now a local server is running by default on port `1234`, you can see the project on your browser now ðŸš€ : 
<br />

`http://localhost:1234`

<br />
To run tests, run : 

`yran test`
